This repository has a file that contains all the preprocessing steps and model code.
The dataset used is the famous [Fashion Mnist dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/fashion_mnist). 

Dataset Summary:

  * Content: The dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of fashion items, divided into 10 categories.
  * Categories: The 10 classes are T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, and Ankle boot.
  * Image Dimensions: Each image is 28x28 pixels, similar to the original MNIST dataset.
  * Training and Test Sets: The dataset is split into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
  * Purpose: Fashion MNIST is intended to be a drop-in replacement for MNIST, offering a more challenging classification problem while still being small and manageable for testing machine learning algorithms.
  * Usage: It is widely used for testing and benchmarking image classification algorithms, serving as a standard for comparing different models and techniques in machine learning.
