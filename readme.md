# Dataset
This repository has a file that contains all the preprocessing steps and model code.
The dataset used is the famous [Fashion Mnist dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/fashion_mnist). 

Dataset Summary:

  * Content: The dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of fashion items, divided into 10 categories.
  * Categories: The 10 classes are T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, and Ankle boot.
  * Image Dimensions: Each image is 28x28 pixels, similar to the original MNIST dataset.
  * Training and Test Sets: The dataset is split into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
  * Purpose: Fashion MNIST is intended to be a drop-in replacement for MNIST, offering a more challenging classification problem while still being small and manageable for testing machine learning algorithms.
  * Usage: It is widely used for testing and benchmarking image classification algorithms, serving as a standard for comparing different models and techniques in machine learning.

## Introduction

In this notebook, we build and evaluate a deep learning model to identify different types of clothing from images using the Fashion MNIST dataset.

## Importing Libraries

This section involves importing necessary libraries like TensorFlow, Matplotlib, and NumPy, which are essential for building and training the machine learning model, as well as for data manipulation and visualization.

## Loading the Dataset

The Fashion MNIST dataset is loaded and divided into training and test sets. This dataset contains images of different clothing items, which will be used to train and evaluate the model.

## Data Exploration

In this section, the shape and basic properties of the dataset are explored to understand its structure. This includes checking the dimensions of the training data to ensure it is loaded correctly.

## Data Preprocessing

### Data Normalization

The pixel values of the images are scaled from the range 0-255 to 0-1. This normalization step is crucial for improving the performance and convergence speed of the neural network.

### Data Reshaping

The images are reshaped to include the number of channels (1 in this case, as the images are grayscale). This step is necessary to make the data compatible with the input requirements of the convolutional neural network.

### One-Hot Encoding Labels

The labels are converted from integer format to one-hot encoded format. This transformation is important for classification tasks as it allows the model to output probabilities for each class.

## Model Building

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is constructed to classify the images. The architecture includes multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The model is then compiled with an optimizer, a loss function, and evaluation metrics.

## Model Evaluation

The trained model is evaluated on the test set to determine its performance. This involves calculating metrics such as accuracy to see how well the model generalizes to unseen data.

## Prediction

A function is defined to make predictions on new, external images. This involves downloading an image, preprocessing it, and then using the trained model to predict the class of the clothing item in the image.

## Confusion Matrix

A confusion matrix is created and plotted to visualize the model's performance across different classes. This matrix helps in understanding which classes are being predicted correctly and which are being misclassified.

## Saving the Model

The trained model is saved to disk for future use. This allows the model to be reused without retraining, saving time and computational resources.
